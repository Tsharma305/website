                    <p>Named in honor of the trailblazing astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope is a
                        large,
                        space-based
                        observatory, which has revolutionized astronomy since its launch and deployment by the space
                        shuttle
                        Discovery in 1990.
                        Far above rain clouds, light pollution, and atmospheric distortions, Hubble has a crystal-clear
                        view
                        of the universe.
                        Scientists have used Hubble to observe some of the most distant stars and galaxies yet seen, as
                        well
                        as the planets in
                        our solar system.
                        <br><br>
                        Hubble’s capabilities have grown immensely in its over 30 years of operation. This is because
                        new,
                        cutting-edge
                        scientific instruments have been added to the telescope over the course of five astronaut
                        servicing
                        missions. By
                        replacing and upgrading aging parts, these servicing missions have greatly extended the
                        telescope’s
                        lifetime.
                        <br><br>
                        Telescopes have a particular range of light that they can detect. Hubble’s domain extends from
                        the
                        ultraviolet through
                        the visible (which our eyes see) and into the near-infrared. This range has allowed Hubble to
                        deliver stunning images of
                        stars, galaxies, and other astronomical objects that have inspired people around the world and
                        changed our understanding
                        of the universe.
                        <br><br>
                        Hubble has made more than 1.5 million observations over the course of its lifetime. Over 19,000
                        peer-reviewed science
                        papers have been published on its discoveries, and every current astronomy textbook includes
                        contributions from the
                        observatory. The telescope has tracked interstellar objects as they soared through our solar
                        system,
                        watched a comet
                        collide with Jupiter, and discovered moons around Pluto. It has found dusty disks and stellar
                        nurseries throughout the
                        Milky Way that may one day become fully fledged planetary systems and studied the atmospheres of
                        planets that orbit
                        other stars. Hubble has peered back into our universe’s distant past, to locations more than
                        13.4
                        billion light-years
                        from Earth, capturing galaxies merging, probing the supermassive black holes that lurk in their
                        depths, and helping us
                        better understand the history of the expanding universe.
                        <br><br>
                        In its over 30 years of operation, Hubble has made observations that have captured humanity’s
                        imaginations and deepened
                        our knowledge of the cosmos. It will continue to do so for years to come.
