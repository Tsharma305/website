                        <p>In 2020, the Hubble Space Telescope achieves its 30th year in orbit. Hubble’s unique design,
                            allowing it to be repaired
                            and upgraded with advanced technology by astronauts, has made it one of NASA’s
                            longest-living
                            and most valuable
                            space-based observatories, beaming transformational astronomical images to Earth for
                            decades.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Hubble has fundamentally changed our understanding of the cosmos, and its story — filled
                            with
                            challenges overcome by
                            innovation, determination, and the human spirit — inspires us.
                            <br>
                            <br>


                            Throughout the year, we’ll celebrate the many ways that Hubble has brought the universe home
                            to
                            Earth with new images,
                            videos, and documentaries, interactive features, social media events, and more.

                            <h4>Cosmic Reef</h4>
                            <p>This Hubble 30th anniversary image, nicknamed the “Cosmic Reef” because of its
                                resemblance to an underwater world, shows
                                how young, energetic, massive stars illuminate and sculpt their birthplace with powerful
                                winds and searing ultraviolet
                                radiation.
                                <br><br>
                                The giant red nebula, NGC 2014, and its smaller blue neighbor, NGC 2020, belong to a
                                star-forming region in the Large
                                Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, located 163,000 light-years away.
                                A sparkling centerpiece of
                                bright, hefty stars — each 10-20 times more massive than our Sun — in the center of the
                                reddish NGC 2014 unleash
                                ultraviolet radiation and winds of charged particles that heat and shape the gas around
                                them.
                                <br><br>
                                The blue areas in NGC 2014 reveal the glow of oxygen, heated to nearly 20,000 degrees
                                Fahrenheit by the blast of
                                ultraviolet light. The cooler, red gas indicates the presence of hydrogen and nitrogen.
                                <br><br>
                                The blue nebula at lower left has been created by a solitary, mammoth star 200,000 times
                                brighter than our Sun. This
                                nebula's gas was ejected by the star through a series of eruptive events as the star
                                cast off some of its outer layers.

                            <h4>Rubin's Galaxy</h4>
                            <p>This image, which kicked off Hubble’s 30th anniversary commemoration, captures a majestic
                                spiral galaxy that's 2.5 times
                                wider than our Milky Way and contains 10 times as many stars. It appears to have been
                                sitting quietly over billions of
                                years, birthing stars at about half the rate of the Milky Way. The galaxy, UGC 2885, has
                                been nicknamed "Rubin's
                                galaxy," after astronomer Vera Rubin (1928 – 2016), who studied this galaxy's rotation
                                rate in search of dark matter.
                                <br><br>
                                Astronomers seek to understand the galaxy’s huge size, investigating whether the galaxy
                                consumed much smaller satellite
                                galaxies over time or built up its mass by slowly and steadily accreting gas for new
                                stars.
                                <br><br>
                                A number of foreground stars in our Milky Way can be seen in the image, identified by
                                their cross-shaped diffraction
                                spikes.
