                        <br>
                        <p>In the quest to unravel the mysteries of the universe, a revolutionary innovation emerged â€“
                            the
                            space telescope. Unlike
                            its Earth-bound counterparts, a space telescope orbits high above the interference of our
                            planet's atmosphere, unlocking
                            a realm of possibilities and discoveries that were once unimaginable. Let's delve into the
                            captivating reasons why a
                            space telescope, like the iconic Hubble, is an indispensable tool in humanity's pursuit of
                            cosmic understanding.</p>
